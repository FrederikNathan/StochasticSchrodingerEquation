# StochasticSchrodingerEquation
Code for solving stochastic schrodinger equation in a periodically driven quantum system

Code generates and relies on data saved on disk, for efficiency. From the the directory where the code is saved, the following directories should therefore exist for the code to work:

Directories with log files
../Logs
../Logs/SSE
../Logs/JumpOperators
../Logs/FloquetOperatorGenerator
../Logs/OperatorSpectrum

Directories for data
../Data
../Data/JumpOperators
../Data/FloquetSpectra
../Data/InteractionPictureEvolutions


All generated data is saved in ../Data/InteractionPictureEvolutions
